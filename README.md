#Recommendations with IBM

A notebook excersice where I practiced:

(1) Rank based recommendations
(2) User-user based collaborative filtering
(3) Content based recommendations (optional, will finished later)
(4) Matrix factorization.

This project is based on IBM Watson Studio user-article interaction data. The code is built on Udacity's course content.
