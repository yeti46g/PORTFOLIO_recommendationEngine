# Recommendations with IBM


A notebook exercise where I practiced:

	(1) Rank based recommendations
	(2) User-user based collaborative filtering
	(3) Content based recommendations (optional, will finish later)
	(4) Matrix factorization.

This project is based on IBM Watson Studio user-article interaction data. The code is built on Udacity's course content.
